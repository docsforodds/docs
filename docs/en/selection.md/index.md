<font size="3">Below we have chosen Soccer and named the Selection ‘Low Tier Leagues’. The user can search for all available markets in that chosen sport and tick the ones they wish for that specific selection. There is also the option to offer just one outcome from a market. Example in this case we selected just the ‘YES’ selection from the market both teams to score.

After creating a new selection the user can choose it from the drop down on the top right of the window in match odds. This can be set for a whole sport, country, league or even a single event. Every one of them can override its parent’s setting. As you can see below the 3-way odds and both teams to score selection ‘YES’ are shown in blue whilst other markets which weren’t selected in the ‘Low Tier Leagues’ selection are shown in black in a filled grey box..</font>
