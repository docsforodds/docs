<font size="3"> No matter if base odds are set manually or if they are received, dependent odds can be recalculated by clicking calculate button. The odds in the box filled in white are the odds received from the feed (or since they are base odds they can be changed by user), whilst the odds under it which are in a box filled in grey are the odds which will be exported out of the tool. These odds will have the desired margin set by the user.</font>
