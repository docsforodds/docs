<font size="3">All odds when they are being received, presented, calculated and exported are scaled specifically to fit their margin. It can be seen in the margin box for every odds type and if odds are maintained manually, it can be changed as well. For that user just has to click the * button and the odds will scale according to the newly set margin.


For every sport and every game it contains, default margins are already set. 2 rows can be seen in the above image: the upper row shows the odds received with the feed margin, the lower row shows the odds that are being exported with the default margin (or with the margin set up in the margin set). Users can predefine default margins for any odds type within a specific sport. This option is provided in the menu bar under Edit -> Margin Sets -> Edit default. In the new window that will appear, after choosing the sport, the default margin for the selected sport will show up. To change the values, simply set the wanted margin and click Save. After getting a confirmation message, that new margin will be in use.</font>

<font size="3">For every specific sport, tournament, category or match custom set of margins for its odds types can be set. By clicking Edit -> Margin Sets in the menu bar, options for adding, removing, editing and generating existing margins sets appear. All sets are listed in the table along with the sport they are related to. You also have the option to search for the margin set by sport. Inside this window the user can decide which personalized margin to apply for each market. Other than that, there is the possibility to distribute the margin in different ways. These are scaled, balanced and mixed.

Edit existing margin set
Clone settings of selected margin set and generate new one
Delete selected margin set
To add a new margin set you must click the ‘New’ button on the top right of the margin sets window. A small window will appear to choose which sport you wish to create the new margin set.

For example, if margin set 105% is set for let’s say Soccer, all its categories (England, Italy, Germany, International ...) will inherit that setting. However, a single category may want to have a set different from 105%. It can simply be done by choosing some other margin set for the mentioned category after it has been chosen in the Odds Tree. Similarly, tournaments inherit settings from their parent categories, and matches from tournaments likewise. Every one of them can override its parent’s setting.

As you can see in the image below we have selected the match Liverpool FC vs Norwich City and chose the margin 105% from the margin sets. So your odds will be exported at the chosen margins in the margin set, in this case markets set to 105%.


A shortcut to change the margin for a specific market on the current margin set is done by clicking the 3 dots on the top right-hand side of the market and clicking ‘change the margin for this market’. This command will open the same page used for editing a margin set but will automatically take you to the chosen market.

If a user wishes to change margins for just that specific match in a faster way, they should click clone margin set on top left. This would generate a margin set exactly as the one which the event is on. If the match is Liverpool FC vs Norwich City ,the margin set would be named ‘Liverpool FC vs Norwich City’ followed by the date of the event. Therefore, this will allow you to change margins for just this specific match. This margin set will be automatically deleted after 24 hours of the event.</font>

<font size="3">Per esempio, se viene impostato il margine 105% all’ interno della sezione “calcio”, tutte le categorie presenti, erediteranno il margine in questione. Tuttavia, è possibile selezionare un margine differente per una singola categoria. Infatti, non sempre tutti i tornei ereditano lo stesso margin set di livello superiore.</font>
