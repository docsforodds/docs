<font size="3">This is used to add new languages to the tool. For example you wish to have Soccer in Italian. The user must click on the 3 dots next to the desired sport and select ‘Translations’. A new window will appear were you must type the new translation for Soccer which in Italian is ‘Calcio’ and the language tag which is ‘it’. When saving, the tool will start to export the sport language Soccer in both English and Italian. This can be done for Sports, Categories, Tournaments and also teams or Players.</font>
