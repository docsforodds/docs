 <font size="3">This feature is used to change date & time manually if you are following the feed. When changing the date or time manually it will block any updates from the feed. In the image above we changed the time from ‘21:00’ to ‘20:00’. As you can see below the event now has a ‘D’ sign, this indicates that the event is date locked. If you want the event to follow the date & time updates of the feed again you have to remove this and you can do this action by either clicking on the ‘D’ and select ‘Remove Date Locking’ or from the events page you can click on the yellow warning sign and also select ‘Remove Date Locking’.</font>
