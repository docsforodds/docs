<font size="3">Questa barra contiene informazioni relative allo stato dei servizi esterni collegati all’applicazione. La barra in questione è posizionata in basso alla fine della schermata del tool.</font> 

---

<font size="3">You can view the following functions:</font> 

 ---

 - <font size="3">Import of fixtures and odds;</font> 

 - <font size="3">Alerts processing;</font> 

 - <font size="3">Export of fixture and odds to BO and Betradar;</font>

<font size="3">This part is only informational. Here user can see the state of outside services that are connected to the application. There is a signal light for each, importing events, maintaining them by alert catching and exporting all changes in order to be up to date with the received data.

The 3 above should be always green. If one of them turns to Red and stays like that for approximately more than 15 minutes, the user should contact us so that we can look into it. The problem will probably be that their will be a lot of files to export and eventually the tool will catch up and turn back to green but to avoid any further issues you should contact us.</font>
