<font size="3">In order to access the events of the results the user must click the ‘Load Finished’ tab and navigate through the Green Tree which is organised similarly to the Blue Tree with odds. Since there are more matches in it, now they are grouped by date within a single tournament. Results of an event can be viewed when clicking on the green eye.</font>
