 <font size="3">Outrights are special types of events that have odds just like fixtures do, and are situated in the same location but in a different tab. You can think of it as a special match that has two or more competitors and can last much longer, over a whole season for example. Every outright has only one of the three possible game types: Championship Winner, Single Event Winner and Podium Finish. Here, outcomes are actually competitors so you have odds for each one of them. As well as for matches’ odds types, margin can be changed and odds scaled to fit it for outrights too. The outright’s odds can also be maintained manually. To do so, flag the provided box and the feed will no longer update the selected competitor. After every manual change the Update button will commit your newly set odds. At any time, by unchecking the same box, you can go back to receiving the feed. The user can also create his own outright manually by clicking on the 3 dots next to the required tournament and selecting ‘Insert new outright’. Then you must name the outright, choose the outright type, set the date (when the event will start(this will identify when you want to set the outright offline) and when it will end(this will identify when you want to set the outright in results)) and choose the competitors which you can find by clicking ‘Show ALL competirors’. As done before you can create new competitors and will be automatically saved with the list. When clicking insert you will add your own outright which you can find in under its category in the outrights section. When manually created outright closes and you wish to bring it back you must go in results and change the date.</font>
