<font size="3">With this feature the user can decide to set a rule for changing margin sets and selection automatically according to the rules set. This is found in the menu bar from Edit->Margin and selection change rules. A new window will open with the option to set a new rule or view current rules. In the below example we added a rule for all soccer to automatically set events (which have the 3-way and O/U 2.5 odds below 1.05) to use the selection ‘3way only’. You can edit or delete current rules, or even create a rule for a specific category or tournament that will override the settings of the parent level.</font>
