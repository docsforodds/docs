 <font size="3">Users can create new categories, tournaments, matches, one-competitor matches and outrights (See outrights in section (8)). Parent hierarchy is followed here, so in order to insert a category that belongs to some sport, the user must click the 3 dots next to the chosen sport and select ‘Insert new category’. In the window that appears, the name of the category that is being created should be entered. User can stop here and just click Insert OR add new tournament into the category by writing its name. Again, you can insert now, OR you can choose to insert a match into the above tournament at once. If you choose that, fill all the necessary match details which are teams and date & time. You can choose the teams from drop down menu or create your own by clicking the + sign(this will be saved with the list). When done click insert. The Blue Tree with events will be updated automatically and you will see your newly added events. It is important to bear in mind that when creating new events they will inherit their parent’s settings for margins and selections.</font>
